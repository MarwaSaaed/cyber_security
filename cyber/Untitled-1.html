          <h3>Vigenere Algorithm</h3>
          <p>
            The vigenere cipher is an algorithm that is used to encrypting and decrypting the text.
             The vigenere cipher is an algorithm of encrypting an alphabetic text that uses a series of interwoven caesar ciphers.
              It is based on a keyword's letters. It is an example of a polyalphabetic substitution cipher. 
              This algorithm is easy to understand and implement. This algorithm was first described in 1553 by Giovan Battista Bellaso. 
            It uses a Vigenere table or Vigenere square for encryption and decryption of the text. The vigenere table is also called the tabula recta.

           <h3>Auto key Algorithm</h3>
           <p>
            An autokey cipher (also known as the autoclave cipher) is a cipher that incorporates the message (the plaintext) into the key.
             The key is generated from the message in some automated fashion, sometimes by selecting certain letters from the text or, more commonly,
              by adding a short primer key to the front of the message.

            There are two forms of autokey cipher: key-autokey and text-autokey ciphers. A key-autokey cipher uses previous members 
            of the keystream to determine the next element in the keystream. A text-autokey uses the previous message text to determine the next element in the keystream.
            
            In modern cryptography, self-synchronising stream ciphers are autokey ciphers.

           <h3>
               Casear Algorithm
           </h3>
           <p>
            The Caesar Cipher technique is one of the earliest and simplest method of encryption technique. 
            It’s simply a type of substitution cipher, i.e., each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. The method is apparently named after Julius Caesar, who apparently used it to communicate with his officials. 
            Thus to cipher a given text we need an integer value, known as shift which indicates the number of position each letter of the text has been moved down. 
            The encryption can be represented using modular arithmetic by first transforming the letters into numbers, according to the scheme,
            
            A = 0, B = 1,…, Z = 25. Encryption of a letter by a shift n can be described mathematically as.

               Playfair Cypher
           </h3>
           <p>
            The Playfair cipher was the first practical digraph substitution cipher. The scheme was invented in 1854 by Charles Wheatstone 
            but was named after Lord Playfair who promoted the use of the cipher. In playfair cipher unlike traditional
             cipher we encrypt a pair of alphabets(digraphs) instead of a single alphabet.
            It was used for tactical purposes by British forces in the Second Boer War and in World War I and for the same purpose by the
             Australians during World War II. This was because Playfair is reasonably fast to use and requires no special equipment.
