          <h2>Vigenere Algorithm</h2>
          <p>
            The vigenere cipher is an algorithm that is used to encrypting and decrypting the text.
             The vigenere cipher is an algorithm of encrypting an alphabetic text that uses a series of interwoven caesar ciphers.
              It is based on a keyword's letters. It is an example of a polyalphabetic substitution cipher. 
              This algorithm is easy to understand and implement. This algorithm was first described in 1553 by Giovan Battista Bellaso. 
            It uses a Vigenere table or Vigenere square for encryption and decryption of the text. The vigenere table is also called the tabula recta.
